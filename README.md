# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict real estate prices based on various features using linear regression.
The dataset contains the following features:

- **Number of Convenience Stores**: This represents the number of convenience stores near each property. It is measured as the count of convenience stores within a certain radius, typically within a certain distance threshold (e.g., 1 kilometer) from the property location.<br>

- **Age**: This refers to the age of the house and is measured in years.<br>

- **Distance to the Nearest MRT Station**: This indicates the distance from each property to the nearest Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station. It is measured in meters.<br>

- **House Price of Unit Area**: This represents the price of each property per unit area and is typically measured in New Taiwan Dollar (TWD) per square meter.<br>
